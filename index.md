My name is Bodun (though I usually go by Edward). I'm a Computer Science graduate student in the [SCEA group](https://github.com/utcs-scea) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I'm fortunate enough to collaborate closely with professor [Christopher Rossbach](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/). Previously, I also worked to professor [Simon Peter](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~simon/) on multiple projects. I will be joining [WISR Lab](https://wisr.cs.wisc.edu/) under the supervision of professor [Aditya Akella](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~akella/) for my Ph.D. starting at Fall 2021.

My research focuses on the intersection of operating systems, heterogeneity, and network. I am particularly interested in applying novel solutions to system designs where resource management is complex and challenging.

One of the main objectives of my ongoing projects is to reason about suitable abstractions for multi-accelerator operating systems and provide insights in how to design modern operating systems for data centers to reduce data movement overhead.

I obtained both MSc and BS in Computer Science at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), in May 2021, under the supervision of Prof. [Christopher Rossbach](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/). My research had focused on modernizing GPGPU benchmarking, as well as automate API forwarding to OS kernel space applications.
