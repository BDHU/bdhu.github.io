My <img class="profile-picture" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/BDHU/bdhu.github.io/assets/img/logo.jpg"> name is Bodun (though I usually go by Edward). I'm a CS PhD student in the [UTNS](https://utns.cs.utexas.edu/) lab at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) 🤘.  I am advised by [Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/) and work closely with [Neeraja Yadwadkar](https://sites.utexas.edu/neeraja/). Before I started my PhD, I was fortunate enough to collaborate closely with professor [Christopher Rossbach](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/) on heterogeneous computing systems at [SCEA group](https://github.com/utcs-scea). I also worked with professor [Simon Peter](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~simpeter/) on programmable switches.

My research focuses on the intersection of operating systems, network, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in developing systems for ML, and applying ML techniques to systems.

I obtained both MS and BS in Computer Science at the [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), where I worked on modernizing GPU benchmarking and accelerating OS kernel access to accelerators.
