title: "Bodun Hu"
---

My name is Bodun (though I usually go by Edward). I'm a CS PhD student in the [UTNS](https://utns.cs.utexas.edu/) research group at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), led by professor [Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/). Before I started my PhD, I was fortunate enough to collaborate closely with professor [Christopher Rossbach](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/) on heterogeneous computing systems at [SCEA group](https://github.com/utcs-scea). I also worked with professor [Simon Peter](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~simon/) on programmable switches :metal:.

My research focuses on the intersection of operating systems, network, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in applying novel solutions to system designs where resource management is complex and challenging.

I obtained both MS and BS in Computer Science at the [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), where I worked on modernizing GPGPU benchmarking, as well as automating API forwarding to OS kernel space applications.

Visit my [blog](https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/) :memo: to find out what I've been working on recently as well as other updates.
