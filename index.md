title: "Bodun Hu"

My <img class="profile-picture" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/BDHU/bdhu.github.io/assets/img/logo.jpg"> name is Bodun (though I usually go by Edward). I’m a CS PhD student at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) 🤘, working in the [UTNS](https://utns.cs.utexas.edu/) lab with [Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/) and [Atlas Wang](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/atlas-wang). My research lies at the intersection of operating systems, network, and machine learning. I love building systems for ML and using ML to enhance systems.

Before my PhD, I worked with [Christopher Rossbach](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/) on heterogeneous computing at [SCEA lab](https://github.com/utcs-scea), and with [Simon Peter](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~simpeter/) on programmable switches.

I have a MS and a BS in Computer Science from UT Austin, where I also worked on GPU benchmarking and enabling OS kernel access to accelerators.

Check out my [blog](https://www.bodunhu.com/blog/) for my latest projects and news.
